Challenge: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/acm-icpc-team/


Notes
-----

Ruby, it appears, can handle arbitrarily large integers, though it
appears at a massive performance cost.  C++, no so much, of course.  Derp.

For an easy challenge, the massive red herring of "use bitwise OR"
makes tougher than it ought to be.
